# 4-Bit Password Security System

## Project Overview
The **4-Bit Password Security System** is a digital logic design project that demonstrates implementing a basic password authentication mechanism using digital components. The project simulates a simple yet effective security system that validates a user's 4-bit password and indicates access status via LED feedback.

## Motivation
The growing importance of secure authentication systems inspired this project. It provides a practical example of applying digital logic concepts in designing and implementing a password security system, making it suitable for educational purposes.

## Objectives
- Design and implement a 4-bit password-based security system.
- Validate user input through digital logic components.
- Simulate and test the system using **Proteus software**.
- Demonstrate practical applications of digital logic in security systems.

## Features
- **Input Unit**: Four DIP switches for 4-bit password entry.
- **Processing Unit**: Digital logic gates (AND, OR, NOT) for password validation.
- **Output Unit**: LEDs to indicate whether access is granted or denied.

## System Design
The system is divided into three primary units:
1. **Input Unit**:
    - Four DIP switches represent the 4-bit password input.
2. **Processing Unit**:
    - Logical operations using AND, OR, and NOT gates validate the password.
3. **Output Unit**:
    - LEDs provide visual feedback on the password validation result.

## Implementation
- The project was designed and simulated in **Proteus software**.
- Components used include:
  - Logic gates (AND, OR, NOT).
  - DIP switches for input.
  - LEDs for output feedback.

### Steps
1. Design the circuit schematic in Proteus.
2. Simulate the circuit to ensure functionality.
3. (Optional) Implement the system on hardware.

## Results
The system successfully:
- Validates the predefined 4-bit password.
- Activates an access LED when the correct password is entered.
- Activates a denied LED for incorrect inputs.

## Limitations
- Supports only a single predefined password.
- Does not scale for multiple users or dynamic passwords.

## Future Enhancements
- Support for variable-length passwords.
- Integration of a display for user feedback.
- Hardware implementation for real-world applications.

## Engineering Impact
### Social and Environmental Impact
- Demonstrates practical applications of digital logic for enhancing security.
- Environmentally friendly as it uses minimal resources in simulation.

### Educational Value
This project serves as an excellent example for students learning about:
- Digital logic components and design.
- Password validation mechanisms.
